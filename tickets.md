## Bugs

## Features

* Create a shopping list.  Trigger different outcomes based on it.

* UI candy?
* Admin System
  + Shows you all the tracks (stack overflow danger!)
  + Allows you to select a frame
  + Allows you to add options to a frame

## Completed

  + Figure out the ?0 - make a boilerplate so that it doesn't bug out when there's nothing there.
  + Deal with end-of-the-line
  + User can still click old bulletpoints.  Should only be able to click the last ones.
  + Auto-scroll to last item
  + Save state to URL
* Images
  + Add an `image` parameter to each `scene` in our `scenes` array.  The value of each `image` property should be the address from an image somewhere on the web.
    - Protip: If you right-click on any image on the internet, then click "copy image address", you'll have a URL to use for your `image` properties: http://snpy.in/SXTPIa
  + Update the `view.ts` file to add an image element to each `sceneElem` , so that each scene the user sees has an image displayed in it.
* Pointer for clicking
  + When a user hovers over an option, their mouse should turn into a pointer.
    - Protip: CSS is for how things look.
